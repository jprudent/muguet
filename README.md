## Schemas

Schemas are using malli internally.

Some metadata are expected to be provided in the schema  

## Notes 

Runs on NodeJS and JVM

Schemas can be written in JSON, following the strapi notation

Inspired a lot from Strapi

Tailwind + Figwheel

Use native web platform
https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/working-with-react-and-the-web-platform/

Multimedia library
- provide image resizing capabilities

Authentication:
- give granular reponsabilities

Provide rich types, like blog post ?

Document lifecycle (do better than Strapi)

Be event based, so can plug other systems

Be temporality

Localization

Build apps

Developer oriented (aka not just a CRUD): web content definition is created once 
and users will have specific needs over time. A CMS may not be the right piece
of software to implement business logic. But Muguet is a different type of
CMS that provides developer tools for customisizing the user experience
beyond basic needs.

Infinitite relations, reusable infinitely, no quirks (like in Strapi "components")

Development workflow must be seamless (auto-reloading, repl-driven, ...)

Plugins & Plugin exentions (to improve base plugins)

Provides other ports than http

What about free form documents ?

Inferring schemas

Providing generators

i18n & localization

Deeply nested documents

Write a schema converter from Strapi to Muguet

Messages d'erreur i18n

Schemas must be extensible with 3rd-party libs that provides rich types. For 
instance EAN, or RDF types !

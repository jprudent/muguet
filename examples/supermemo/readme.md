Supermemo is a spaced repetition learning program

It's a showcase for Muguet RAD, so some technical aspects of it is driven by that.

It's originally designed to help my kid learning grammar.

It consists of flashcards that contains:

- a topic (for instance, conjugaison, grammar, spelling, ...)
- a question that should provide a meaningful context where the matter was encounter in reality
- a response

The application doesn't check response. The user mentally try to respond, and rate its reponse from 0 to 5.

It implements [SM2+ algorithm](https://www.blueraja.com/blog/477/a-better-spaced-repetition-learning-algorithm-sm2)
for spaced repetition.
